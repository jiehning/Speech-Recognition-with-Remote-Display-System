Slip inside the eye of your mind
Don't you know you might find
A better place to play?
You said that you'd never been
But all the things that you've seen
Slowly fade away
So I start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside
summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

And so, Sally can wait 
She knows it's too late
as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
But don't look back in anger
I heard you say
